    "# Polygenic Risk Score Tools Notebooks Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebooks for each tool are organized in the following format:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Polygenic Risk Scores Tool Overview\n",
    "### Installation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation/GitHub/Tool Link**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Discussed the process of installing the tool.\n",
    "- Whether the tool requires Python 2 or 3.\n",
    "- Checked if the tool relies on any other tools or datasets for calculation.\n",
    "- Specified the hyperparameters offered by the tool.\n",
    "- Highlighted the hyperparameters we considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. GWAS Modification\n",
    "### GWAS Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modified the GWAS file as required by the specific tool.\n",
    "- PRS tools expect the GWAS file to:\n",
    "  - Be in a specific format.\n",
    "  - Have specific headers.\n",
    "  - GWAS should be in a specific format before it is passed to Notebook/Code.\n",
    "- Continuous phenotypes: Ensure the `BETA` (effect size) column is in the GWAS.\n",
    "- Binary phenotypes: Ensure the `OR` (odd ratio) column is in the GWAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Define Plink Hyperparameters\n",
    "### Define PRS Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specified clumping and pruning parameters for the genotype data.\n",
    "- Defined the number of principal components (PCA).\n",
    "- Defined the number of p-value thresholds (More p-values, better results. PRS is calculated for each p-value threshold.  Combined PRS with covariates and PCA for the final prediction).\n",
    "- Specified the fold number for which the code should be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Helper Functions for Cleaning Data\n",
    "### Define Clumping/Pruning Functions and Functions to Fit the PRS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Defined a function to calculate PCA from the genotype data.\n",
    "- Defined a function to perform clumping and pruning.\n",
    "- Defined a function to fit the binary phenotype using logistic regression (`LOGIT`).\n",
    "  - Merges covariates, PCA, and PRS.\n",
    "  - One can use different regularization terms when fitting the model.\n",
    "  - One can use different evaluation metrics.\n",
    "- Defined a function to fit the continuous phenotype using ordinary least squares (`OLS`).\n",
    "  - Merges covariates, PCA, and PRS.\n",
    "  - One can use different regularization terms when fitting the model.\n",
    "  - One can use different evaluation metrics.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## 5. Execute Tool\n",
    "### Execute the Code for a Specific Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deleted files from previous iterations.\n",
    "- Executed the code for the specific tool, phenotype, and fold.\n",
    "- Modified the GWAS and genotype files if required by the tool.\n",
    "- For some tools, genotype data must be split across each phenotype.\n",
    "- Calculated additional parameters, such as heritability for `GCTA`, if needed.\n",
    "- Calculated the PRS using `PLINK` with posterior effect sizes estimated by the tool.\n",
    "- Saved the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Repeat the Process for Each Fold\n",
    "### Change the Fold Number in the 3rd Step\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verified that the result file was generated.\n",
    "- Checked the number of rows in the result file.\n",
    "- Changed the fold number and executed the code for each fold.\n",
    "- Ensured that files were generated for each fold.\n",
    "- Summed the results across all folds, making sure the sum corresponds to the correct rows.\n",
    "- If the code failed for some datasets (e.g., negative heritability), discarded those rows for that fold.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Evaluate the Results\n",
    "### Find the Best-Performing Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identified the best performance parameters across all folds.\n",
    "- Used two methods to report performance:\n",
    "  - The test performance corresponding to the highest training performance across all rows.\n",
    "  - Generalized performance where the difference between train and test performance is minimal, but their sum is high.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Conclusion\n",
    "### Review Logs Generated by the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- Performed various analyses, such as:\n",
    "  - Assessing the impact of different hyperparameters on performance.\n",
    "  - Plotting the correlation between hyperparameters and train and test performance.\n",
    "  - Reporting the p-values that yield the best performance.\n",
    "- Reviewed the logs generated by the notebook to ensure proper execution.\n"
